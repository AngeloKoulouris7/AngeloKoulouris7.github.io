<b>The Belt of Faith: Parasite Montage Analysis</b>
<b>By Angelo Koulouris</b>
<b>Word Count: 1000</b>

Montage—as Soviet film theorist Sergei Eisenstein defines it—is made up of five different categories: ‘Metric’, ‘Rhythmic’, ‘Tonal’, ‘Overtonal’ and ‘Intellectual’ montage (1929/1969), these can be used to emotionally or physiologically shock audiences into accepting a political or social concept. These methods serve as different ways to conceptualise the abstract “[ideas] that arise from the collision of independent shots” (1929/1969, p. 49)—which Eisenstein suggests—will “[cause] the perceiver to absorb the political theme” (Bordwell, 1993, p. 116).
Overtonal montage “represents a level related to the preceding levels” (Eisenstein, 1929/1969, p. 78) in which the combination of Metric, Rhythmic and Tonal qualities transform a sequence from a “melodically emotional [colouring] to a directly physiological perception” (1929/1969, p. 78). This can be no better seen than through the ‘Belt of Faith’ montage in Bong Joon Ho’s 2019 black comedy film, <i>Parasite</i>, “a seven-minute tour de force sequence that serves as a… conclusion to the first half of the film” (Han, 2022, p. 186). This essay will explore how Bong utilised Eisenstein’s theories to construct an overtonal montage that encapsulates “the dynamics at play within the larger movie” (2022, p. 188), while reinforcing its key theme of class inequality. 

The first category, Metric montage, dictates that shots are “joined together according to their [absolute] lengths, in a formula-scheme corresponding to a measure of music” (Eisenstein, 1929/1969, p. 78). The focus of this method is cutting to exact measurements—whether that be specific amounts of frames or in time with music—for directors to create a “sensual impression” (1929/1969, p. 79) on the audience. 
This idea can be seen two minutes into the montage, as the Kim family begin to scheme how to replace current housekeeper, Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun), with their mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin). Composer Jung Jae-il’s orchestral score “The Belt of Faith” has been underpinning the entire sequence thus far, “[shifting] in tempo and tone to match the changing scenes” (Han, 2022, p. 188). But as soon as the Kim’s begin their final plot, the visual language of the film suddenly becomes in sync with the 3/8-time signature of the music. Bong employs the use of slow motion as the editing begins to cut in time to the beat, the combination of which “[brings] into unison the ‘pulsing’ of the film and the ‘pulsing’ of the audience” (Eisenstein, 1929/1969, p. 79). This subtly influences the audience to experience a sense of surrealism and physically engage with the emotional tone of the sequence. 
Though Bong doesn’t make use of just metric montage throughout this entire sequence—as will be explored later—Bong purposefully edited the footage of the film to construct this constant pulse that underscores every scene during the montage. Thus, keeping in line with Eisenstein’s ideas that “in order to affect spectators emotionally and intellectually… the production must manipulate their physical states” (Bordwell, 1993, p. 116).

In contrast to metric montage’s notion of using exact measurements to determine shot lengths, “in rhythmic montage it is movement within the frame that impels the montage movement from frame to frame” (Eisenstein, 1929/1969, p. 81). The focus of rhythmic montage is placed less upon absolute measurements but rather the “practical length [derived] from the specifics of the piece” (1929/1969, p. 76) and the emotional impact it can create.
This is best exemplified with the sequence of Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) attempting to convince Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong) that her housekeeper, Moon-gwang, has active tuberculosis by exploiting her life-threatening peach allergy. Shots of Ki-taek fabricating a story of Moon-gwang’s health to Yeon-gyo are juxtaposed with the past, as it is revealed everything Ki-taek says has been rehearsed with lines pre-written by his son, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), who has orchestrated this deceptive plan. 
Bong’s temporal cross-cutting in this sequence creates a steady rhythm of rising tension that makes the audience “feel like [they’re] watching a heist” (Han, 2022, p. 188), forming a dialogue between the past and present as Ki-taek manipulates Yeon-gyo’s emotions into believing him. With the full extent of the Kim family’s preparation for this act of sabotage and deception illustrating to the audience how “the ‘weak’ are fighting among themselves” (2022, p. 188).

Unlike metric and rhythmic montage, Eisenstein suggests that tonal “montage is based on the characteristic emotional sound of the piece – of its dominant” (1929/1969, p. 81). Here, shots are cut based on the emotional ‘tone’ of an aural or visual element within the frame, creating thematic connections through their correlation. 
The unifying tones of The Belt of Faith are class inequality and deception, which Bong reinforces using mirrored visual images throughout the montage. By depicting the Park family’s wealth through shots of their spacious, pristine hilltop house, a luxurious Mercedes-Benz and an expensive plate of fruit, which are then juxtaposed with the Kim’s messy, cramped semi-basement home and an identical shot of a cheap-looking pizza. Bong is able to “create emotional and expressive effects by weaving associative networks” (Bordwell, 1993, p. 120) between the Kim’s and Park’s disparate lives, encouraging the audience to support the Kim’s underdog status despite their destructive actions. 
This culminates in the “powerful emotional climax” (1993, p. 120) at the end of the sequence, as Ki-taek sprays hot sauce on a tissue used by Moon-gwang to mimic the sight of blood. Bong converges the tonalities of class inequality—through the call back to Ki-woo squirting hot sauce on pizza—with the Kim family’s deceptive actions. The associative qualities of the sequence conveying clearly to the audience the monetary “vertical distance separating the Parks from the Kims” (Han, 2022, p. 203). 

Bong crafted “The Belt of Faith [to be] essentially Parasite in miniature” (2022, p. 188), condensing all of the films core tonalities into one succinct seven-minute sequence. By combining Eisenstein’s theories of metric montage to physically engage audiences, rhythmic montage to form a dialogue between scenes and tonal montage to weave together thematic ideas. Bong manifested a physiological and emotional response from his audience which—as Eisenstein intended—shocks the audience into comprehending Parasite’s ideological messages.
