<b>Charlie’s Country (Rolf de Heer, 2013)</b>
<b>By Angelo Koulouris</b>

Since his first appearance on screen in Walkabout (1971) at the age of sixteen, David Gulpilil has become not only an icon of Australian cinema but also a leading figure in furthering the representation of Aboriginal culture in film. But in the process of achieving international success and recognition, his career would end up isolating him from his own Yolngu culture and send him spiralling down into addiction.
Set during the Northern Territory Intervention, Rolf de Heer’s 2013 film, Charlie’s Country, critically explores the consequences of social isolation and cultural displacement, using Gulpilil’s (who co-wrote the film) own life experiences as the basis for its own story. Within the film, there is a particular scene set within a prison, where the titular character, Charlie (David Gulpilil), has his long curly hair shaved off by guards in lieu of his incarceration. The film’s use of cinematography, acting and the scene’s relation to the real-life story of Gulpilil elucidates the continued erasure of Aboriginal identity and culture within contemporary Australia, as well as the failures of Australian cinema in representing Aboriginal people on the screen. 

Charlie’s Country illustrates the displacement of Aboriginal culture as legal and social systems put in place by the predominantly white Australia erodes the traditions and livelihoods of Aboriginal communities, forcing them to assimilate into contemporary Australia’s way of life. Charlie, an Aboriginal man living in an outstation community in Arnhem Land, finds himself caught between the contradictions of these two worlds as he struggles to reconcile the loss of his culture and his need to survive. When Charlie—upon reaching his breaking point during the films climax—smashes a police car window with a shovel, he is promptly beat up by a police officer, arrested and sentenced to prison by a court in Darwin. 
The following sequence within the prison proceeds without any dialogue, rather just a quiet ambient piano underscoring the scene of Charlie’s character—and by extension Gulpilil—having his hair shaven off by prison staff. De Heer centres the camera firmly on Charlie’s face using a close-up shot as he stares towards the camera and audience, broken and unresponsive. The black void of a background leaves nothing else in frame to look at except Charlie. The scene holds on this image for its entire duration, as we are shown every shave and clump of hair fall down his shoulders, until all we are left with is Charlie’s face exposed and empty of all life that once existed prior in the film. 
Much like Charlie’s failures earlier in the film to express himself, de Heer emphasises the loss of his cultural identity through focusing on this act of dehumanisation (Columpar, 2019), creating a parallel between his hair being shaven away and the erosion of his own cultural identity and self. De Heer critically illustrates the effects of the Northern Territory Intervention and the consequence it has on Aboriginal populations living there, contrasting against typical Australian filmic depictions of Aboriginal cultures as “ways of life… [that] are assumed to be on the verge of extinction” (Columpar, 2019:60) and turning the audiences’ attention back towards the effects that white social constructs have on these communities. 

The potency of this scene is amplified through the real-life connections that can be made between Charlie’s story in this moment and Gulpilil’s own experiences. Gulpilil was raised by his parents learning a traditional lifestyle in Arnhem Land, away from western influences and becoming an accomplished hunter, tracker and ceremonial dancer at a young age. It was these skills that would end up capturing the attention of English director Nicholas Roeg, who would cast the then unknown sixteen-year-old boy in his film Walkabout as a “noble-savage” (Ebert, 1971) archetypal character—simply called “Black Boy”—despite Gulpilil not knowing any English. Gulpilil would rapidly gain international fame from this role and his apparent talent acting on screen; in travelling to promote the film he would end up meeting many celebrities of the time who taught him more about acting, but also exposed him to substances such as cigarettes, weed and alcohol that would have an “accumulating impact” (Freebury, 2015:252) on his life. 
These substances “foreign to his culture, both [soothed] him and [enraged] him” (de Heer, 2014:4), as during the lowest moments in his life while he was living homeless in the long grass of Darwin, he would succumb to an alcohol addiction. Over the course of five years from 2006, Gulpilil would have multiple altercations with law enforcement, eventually culminating in being sentenced in 2011 for aggravated assault. Director Rolf de Heer, a frequent collaborator of Gulpilil’s on previous films, The Tracker (2002) and Ten Canoes (2006), would then learn of this imprisonment and visit Gulpilil while he was in jail. He would recall upon seeing him that “David looked pretty awful… short hair… expression pretty-well lifeless… [and] understood that he must have been severely depressed” (de Heer, 2014:6). 
De Heer, looking to inspire life back into his friend, would begin to outline ideas for a film for Gulpilil to make, which would result in the start of production for Charlie’s Country only a year later alongside Gulpilil’s rehab. Linking this back to the prison sequence, the scene not only captures the dehumanisation of Charlie’s character within the film, but also the relived experience of Gulpilil at his lowest, “the reexperienced shudder, the retelling, the repeat” (Columpar, 2019:66), drawing out the emotional potency of the scene. The creation of this film highlights not only Charlie’s story and his “sad spiral into alcoholism and depression” (Righelato, 2014), but also Gulpilil’s own personal journey. As de Heer reports Gulpilil to have said upon seeing the film: “It’s my movie! It’s about me!” (de Heer, 2014:15). 

This film also illustrates the failures of the predominantly white Australian film industry “that tends to perpetuate historically entrenched representational tropes” (Columpar, 2019:55) against indigenous populations. Aboriginal characters, even ones played by Gulpilil in films like Crocodile Dundee (1986) and Australia (2008), are often portrayed as exotic and mystical, savage or noble. But de Heer through this film, developed and funded through only domestic Australian and/or Aboriginal companies, ensures that indigenous stories are heard in Australian cinema by placing Gulpilil’s personal story front and centre. The prison sequence also speaks to one final idea, that we are seeing Gulpilil bare, absent of the traditional body paint worn in his prior films, we are not shown a caricature of Aboriginal Australians through Gulpilil’s body, but rather Gulpilil as he is. A sixty-year-old actor who was left to be consumed by alcoholism and forgotten by the public; despite all he had accomplished for Australian cinema. 
Through the prison sequence, Rolf de Heer and David Gulpilil continue to highlight the ongoing erasure and absence of Aboriginal stories within Australian cinema. By utilising Charlie’s story to portray the loss of identity and culture for Aboriginals in contemporary Australia and using Gulpilil’s own life experiences both inside and outside the film industry to forefront issues of representation on screen, they fight against the dominant cultural standards of Australian Cinema and give a voice for Aboriginal communities and problems that would otherwise remain silenced.
