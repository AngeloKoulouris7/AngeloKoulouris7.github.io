<b>“The Greatest Trick the Devil Ever Pulled…”</b>
<b>By Angelo Koulouris</b>
<b>Word Count: 1077</b>
“[Bryan] Singer is clearly a bright talent who, judging by ‘Suspects’, could go far” (Andrew 1995:26). These were the words written by Geoff Andrew for Time Out magazine, comparing the then promising new director to the likes of “Scorsese and Tarantino” (1995:26) with the release of Singer’s sophomore thriller film, The Usual Suspects (1995). It is now safe to say that Singer’s career did not live up to expectations, with his filmography gradually transitioning to superhero films with X-Men (2000) and Superman Returns (2006), as well as mounting sexual assault allegations and lawsuits from 1997 through to 2019. Following an investigation into these allegations and his removal from the directorial helm of Bohemian Rhapsody (2018), Singer’s filmmaking years have come to an end. 
But returning to 1995, The Usual Suspects was released as a small feature film and was Singer’s attempt to break out into the mainstream. Boasting a budget of only 6$ million, the film managed to gross 23$ million domestically and eventually 43.6$ million more internationally, proving to be a smash success in the box office. The film lacked any notable stars for the time, with its biggest name Chazz Palminteri being none of the titular suspects, but rather a police officer. Today, the film will be recognised for Kevin Spacey (another controversial name now tied to this film), who received awards for his performance as Roger ‘Verbal’ Kint. “Thrillers have long been a staple of American moviemaking” (Diwell 1995:26), but Singer endeavoured to make his film stand out by presenting it not as a thriller flick, but rather as a crime/heist film with an element of mystery involved. 

The Usual Suspects begins with a drug deal gone wrong, as Dean Keaton (Garbiel Byrne) bleeds out on a ship in Los Angeles. He is then met with a shadowy figure who he refers to as “Keyser”, before being shot dead and the boat set aflame. The next day, twenty-seven bodies are discovered with only two survivors, a severely burned Hungarian mobster and physically disabled con artist Verbal. Verbal is brought in for questioning by agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), with the rest of the film’s narrative being told through switching between Verbal’s flashbacks of the events that led up to the massacre, and Kujan’s interrogation, as he tries to uncover “Keyser’s” identity. 
This cold opening—reminiscent of other recently released crime films, Carlito’s Way (1993) and Pulp Fiction (1994)—spoils the ending of the film, telling the audience that the main characters face an impending disaster, but being unclear as to who might die, or who was responsible for it. This sets up a sense of intrigue for the audience, who will be looking for answers as to who this “Keyser” is, but Singer uses the audience’s familiarity of mystery conventions against them (Bordwell 2023). The story plays out in a non-linear fashion through Verbal’s potentially unreliable flashbacks, its “narrative-driven [twists relying] on the viewer getting insufficient information” (2023:378) that prevents them from solving the story, but keeps them engaged to see the reveal through to the end. 

As told by Verbal, six weeks prior to the massacre he—alongside criminals Keaton, Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Benicio del Toro) and Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollack)—were arrested in New York and placed into a police lineup for a crime they did not commit. Angered at what they believe is unfair harassment, the five suspects join forces to get revenge on the NYPD by performing a heist on a jewel smuggler being escorted by corrupt officers, exposing them to the public. Through this introduction we see many of the tropes and archetypes that are typical for crime films of the time, such as Scorsese’s Goodfellas (1990) and Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs (1992). An antagonistic police force that serves as a general obstacle for the criminals. Character archetypes like McManus, a violent loose cannon like Goodfellas’ Tommy DeVito; or Keaton, the reluctant criminal who wants to go straight, paralleling De Palma’s character Carlito Brigante. Audiences had grown accustomed to recognising these tropes and understanding the moral ambiguity of the protagonists’ actions, expecting them to either overcome the individualistic obstacles they face or die trying. Singer, however, subverts these expectations with the introduction of the true antagonist, Keyser Söze. 

Following a botched heist, the suspects end up being blackmailed by Söze through his intermediary lawyer, Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), having unknowingly stolen from him in the past. Söze orders the suspects to raid a drug deal between Argentinian and Hungarian cartels and destroy 91$ million worth of cocaine stored on-board a ship—a near suicidal mission—with their families lives on the line should they refuse. Söze functions as a spectre within the plot, always one step ahead of the suspects and police. No one has ever seen him. No one knows for sure if he is even real. Accounts of him border on being horror stories, always leaving one man alive to tell the tale. But everyone—including criminals—fear him. 
Verbal, in describing Söze, claimed that “the greatest trick the Devil ever pulled, was convincing the world that he didn’t exist”, and this ends up becoming the defining identity of the film. The story stops being about the suspects self-contained goal of getting revenge on the police, but a desperate struggle to avoid certain death against an unseen force. The nigh omnipresent “supernatural criminal… Keyser Söze” (Morgenstern 1995) is a manifestation of unease, the knowledge of the heinous acts that are performed in the shadows, but no way of knowing if they are real or not, or who might be committing them. 

The twist of the film is not just centred around who Söze is, but rather its generic twist, switching from an individualistic narrative of criminals performing heists to a wider non-linear narrative, creating suspense from the unknowable greater forces that manipulate society to their whim. Singer’s sophomore effort earned him heavy acclaim and secured his place within Hollywood, which only enabled his darkest tendencies to go unchecked and silence his victims. While The Usual Suspects has cemented itself as a thriller classic that is worth being celebrated, the true monster of the film managed to avoid detection for 24 years, and even after he was finally taken down, there is no knowing who else might lurk in the shadows. The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn’t exist. 
And just like that… he’s gone.
