<b>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes Research Essay</b>
<b>Word Count: 2499</b>
<b>By Angelo Koulouris</b>
In their 1969 critical manifesto for Cahiers du Cinema outlining the intersections between cinema and ideology, Jean-Luc Comolli and Jean Narboni argue that a film “is a particular product, manufactured within a given system of economic relations and involving labour… to produce” (1999, p. 753), becoming a valuable commodity that must be sold and appeal to audiences. However, “as a result of being a material product of the system, it… also [becomes] an ideological product of the system, which in [the Western world] means capitalism” (1999, p. 754). Thus, cinema reflects the ideological and social values of the system which produced it, unconsciously perpetuating or actively criticising the status quo through its depiction of reality. Despite being produced during the patriarchal Hays Code era of Hollywood, Howard Hawks’ musical class-satire film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) has managed to elude any definitive analysis or categorisation of its ideological themes and messaging. On one hand, critics of the film denounce its objectification and sexualisation of its two showgirl protagonists, Lorelei and Dorothy, that reinforce the dominant patriarchal ideas of the time. On the other hand, recent scholarly analysis has reinterpreted the film through a feminist lens, arguing its positive portrayal of female agency and friendship has allowed the film to subvert its inherent ideological construction. Through discussing Comolli and Narboni’s theories that categorise how films confront or adhere to their ideological foundations, this essay aims to explore the conflicting interpretations of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, illustrating why Hawks’ film—despite its satirical narrative—failed to have a clear sociopolitical message due to its adherence to dominant capitalist and patriarchal norms. 

The people of France—following the end of the Second World War—were left in a state of devastation, destruction, and poverty. With the support of the United States’ funded Marshal Plan, France underwent a thirty-year period of rapid economic growth, urbanization, and modernization under its capitalistic system that—while bringing prosperity to the country—increased overall economic inequality and left its citizens feeling socially alienated. This culminated with widespread student demonstrations, general strikes and civil unrest known as the May 68 protests, a revolutionary countercultural movement fighting against capitalist and conservative ideologies. This countercultural idea was what Comolli and Narboni wanted to bring to film magazine Cahiers du Cinema, drawing attention to how “the majority of films… are produced and distributed by the capitalist economic system” (1999, p. 753), serving as products that perpetuate its dominant ideologies. Their critical theory seeks to analyse and identify “which films… allow the ideology a free, unhampered passage… and which attempt to make it turn back and reflect [upon] itself” (1999, p. 753).
To understand this distinction, Comolli and Narboni created five categories to define the different ways film meaning interacts with and is shaped by the ideologies that produce it. Category A is comprised of “films which are imbued through and through with the dominant ideology in pure and unadulterated form” (1999, p. 755), unconsciously conforming to and propagating sociopolitical norms. Category B meanwhile consists “of films which attack their ideological assimilation” (1999, p. 756) explicitly, demonstrating awareness of the system they are a part of and directly confronting its issues through its narrative and mise-en-scene. Category C exists as a middle ground between the two preceding forms, consisting of films that are “not explicitly political, but in some way becomes so through the criticism practiced on it” (1999, p. 756). In this form, the film appears to adhere to its dominant ideology, but through retrospective criticism and analysis by scholars, an underlying political resistance is discovered. Conversely, Category D consists of films that—while containing explicitly political content within their narrative—fail to “effectively criticize the ideological system in which they are embedded [in] because they unquestioningly adopt its language and its imagery” (1999, p. 757). Finally, Category E belongs to films that appear at first to belong to their dominant ideology, only for the narrative to develop in unexpected ways that challenge, criticise or corrode the ideological foundations that the film rests upon, leaving its political intentions ambiguous for the viewer (1999, p. 757).
Comolli and Narboni’s theory provides a framework for critical analysis of how cinema is simultaneously a product and reflection of the capitalist institutions that produce them, with filmmakers choosing to adhere to or challenge its dominant ideological norms. However, as illustrated by Gentlemen Prefer Blondes “whose ideological foundations are at once so evident and so hidden as to escape analysis” (Turim, 1990, I., para. 1), not all film’s political ideologies can be so easily categorised, let alone agreed upon by critics and scholars.

If films are commercial products to be traded and sold to audiences, Category A suggests that what the public wants should correlate exactly to “what the dominant ideology wants” (Comolli and Narboni, 1999, p. 755). To the point that “the notion of a public and its tastes [become entirely] created by the ideology to justify and perpetuate itself… endlessly repeating the same illusion” (1999, p. 755) until the public believes what they see on screen is a perfect ideological depiction of their own reality. As a result, Hawks’ film “[demonstrates] the way the unconscious of patriarchal society has structured film form” (Mulvey, 1975, p. 6) through its scopophilic objectification of women and its regressive double-wedding resolution, propagating conformist gender roles to its audience. 
Lorelei and Dorothy—despite their existence as narratively active female protagonists—are consistently sexualised by the construction of the film’s mise-en-scene and narrative. From Gentlemen Prefer Blondes’ very first scene, it establishes “the leit-motif of erotic spectacle” (1975, p. 11) as they burst into the frame to sing the film’s opening musical number: “A Little Girl From Little Rock”. Wearing identical tight red sequined dresses—their bare legs and cleavage exposed through deliberate gaps in their outfit—the song serves little narrative purpose beyond allowing the “male gaze [to project] its phantasy on to the female figure which is stylized accordingly” (1975, p. 11). To enable the audience’s scopophilic viewing of the sexualised women without any guilt, Hawks frames the musical numbers as performances for spectators within the film’s narrative, making use of “the device of the show-girl [that] allows the two looks to be unified technically without any apparent break in the diegesis” (1975, p. 12). By normalising the male gaze by catering to its scopophilic phantasies, Hawks sells his film as a spectacle for audiences, a product that can be consumed for their viewing pleasure while reinforcing patriarchal notions of women’s bodies being objects of male desire. 
Later in the film, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes pushes this objectification to a literal level during the famous “Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend” sequence. Lorelei—now dressed in a vibrant pink dress—is pursued by indistinct wealthy male suitors as part of a stage show, the camera perpetually keeping her face in the centre of frame, the object of not just the suitors but also the audience’s attention. This conveniently distracts from the mise-en-scene of the sequence, which shows women dressed up as living chandeliers, arms stretched out holding up candelabras as they smile blankly into the distance, restrained and frozen in place. According to Konkle, “the human furniture in this setting suggests that domestic life makes many wives extensions of their homes, fetish objects for the husbands who hold them in domestic bondage” (2016, p. 108), stripping them of any agency or freedom. But the film does not satirise or condemn this aspect, rather, it glamorises it through Lorelei’s gold-digger intentions to marry for money, with “the lyrics [saying that] men are undependable and women have one commodity to exchange, and that for a limited time” (Turim, 1990, II., para. 8). In doing so, Hawks has commercialised the concept of femininity, suggesting that women’s bodies possess an economic value that should be capitalised upon for love, sex, and eventual materialistic bondage in marriage. 
It is no wonder then that Gentlemen Prefer Blondes concludes with a double wedding, as both Lorelei and Dorothy’s sexual agency becomes tamed by men, fulfilling the film’s ideological need to restore patriarchal balance. This regressive resolution “disclose[s] that beneath the ‘joke’ of depicting women in an active sexual role is their exploitation as objects being trotted back and forth” (1990, II., para. 5) for the audience’s viewing pleasure, as the success of this ideological product is derived from its indulgence of an erotic spectacle (1990, I., para. 12). 

Gentlemen Prefer Blondes’ narrative—while not explicitly political—overwhelmingly reflects the dominant ideological structures that produced it. However, through retrospective analysis focusing on the depiction of Lorelei and Dorothy’s characterisation, friendship and agency, film scholars have pushed towards a feminist reinterpretation of Hawks’ satirical intentions, suggesting the film may exist under Category C of Comolli and Narboni’s theory. 
By subverting conventional gender roles, Hawks has given Lorelei and Dorothy unprecedented agency to not only dominate the screen but seize power within a patriarchal system. From the very first moments of the film, they immediately go on the offensive, exploiting the power and authority their bodies have given them to subjugate men (Sikov, 1994, p. 73). Lorelei’s wealthy fiancé and gold-digging target, Gus, sheepishly watches from the crowd, his awe-struck demeanour providing a “comically self-evident contrast to the confident, talented physically attractive… women” (1994, p. 70) on stage. The bold masculine characteristics of the typical male protagonist are completely absent from Gus and instead given to the two showgirls, who by chasing after men rather than being romantically pursued by them seem to reverse patriarchal gender roles (Konkle, 2016, p. 106-107). 
This is shown most explicitly in Dorothy’s musical number “Ain’t There Anybody Here for Love”, where she attempts to seduce various members of the uninterested US Men’s Olympic Team. The athletes—shirtless and wearing skin-coloured shorts—appear to be virtually naked as their robotic exercise routine and gymnastics comprises the entire mise-en-scene for the sequence, their muscular bodies objectified and put on display. However, “according to the principles of the ruling ideology… the male figure cannot bear the burden of sexual objectification” (Mulvey, 1975, p. 12), thus the camera’s gaze exclusively follows Dorothy as she performs alongside them. But this only serves to illustrate how Dorothy and Lorelei, “prevented by their gender from participating in a world order dominated by weaklings… [manage to] seize whatever power they can from their showgirl roles” (Sikov, 1994, p. 76). Hawks’ subversion of these ideologically motivated gender roles shows that these two performers are not burdened by the patriarchal male gaze, but rather that “the power to attract the gaze is theirs, [a] fact of which they never lose sight” (1994, p. 76) of throughout their enduring friendship. 
Though Gentlemen Prefer Blondes’ double wedding sequence at first appears to be an ideological reinforcement of the status quo, Hawks’ subtle direction places focus on the real union between Lorelei and Dorothy, “advising women to focus on… [finding] companionship in female friendship” (Konkle, 2016, p. 102-103). As the two showgirls—wearing identical white wedding dresses—make their way down the aisle, “Hawks consistently films Lorelei and Dorothy as a pair… this visual figure not only [establishing] an enduring bond between the two women, but it also secures their command [over] the image” (Sikov, 1994, p. 74). Even after they arrive at the alter to meet their respective bridegrooms, Gus and Malone, “the men [remain] so tangential to the real union between the two women that they cease to be visible” (1994, p. 86) within the frame. The final image of the film being only Lorelei and Dorothy smiling next to each other as the screen fades to black, a firm rejection of marital ideals that—by adhering to the narrative and visual language of patriarchal ideology—went unnoticed by audiences of its time. The film’s potential political undertones only being realised—as Comolli and Narboni’s theory suggests—through retrospective critical analysis, however “it would be difficult to argue that Dorothy and Lorelei represent radical feminism… [as] they subvert patriarchy—they don’t overturn it” (1994, p. 77).

These two interpretations of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes’ ideological identity exist in conflict with each other, suggesting that the film is “caught in the system [it] wish[es] to break” (Comolli and Narboni, 1999, p. 757) out from. Regardless of Hawks’ political intentions when making the film—as a conformist commercial product or subversive feminist story—its satire does not effectively critique the patriarchal system it is a part of due to its adherence to and celebration of capitalist ideas. 
As a result of Lorelei being simultaneously depicted as a scopophilic object for men’s desire and a subversive feminist protagonist, the film ends up “[arguing] that women need to be ‘gold-diggers’ if they are to succeed in the postwar marriage economy” (Konkle, 2016, p. 111). Lorelei’s understanding and exploitation of her “hourglass figure… [suggests that] the female body is not only a sex object, but also an object of exchange” (Turim, 1990, II., para. 10), a means for her to charm her way into high society and secure her financial future through marriage. “The fifties capitalist must agree, for what is being embodied in Lorelei is the understanding of the exchange value of sex” (1990, II., para. 8) and an implicit acceptance of the patriarchal system, with the caveat of implying “that women can make the most of their situations by insisting on the [economic] terms of their bondage in marriage” (Konkle, 2016, p. 110). 
If Blondes condones Lorelei’s gold-digging philosophy as praiseworthy, then her pursuit of patriarchy incarnate, Piggie (Sikov, 1994, p. 78), demonstrates the film’s willingness to embrace its capitalist foundations. Upon Lorelei meeting the decrepit old man and learning of his South African diamond mines, she immediately imagines a diamond in place of his unflattering head—his wealth becoming her and the audience’s sole focus—as the exploitative implications of the mines become depoliticized. “If [gold-digging] is justified within the film as the female form of capitalist enterprise, what underlies this ‘justification’ is the assumption that capitalism and thus imperialism are unquestioned, natural” (Turim, 1990, III., para 3), and thus accepted by both the film and its audience, whose ideological beliefs are aligned. Hawks’ “satire does not touch this assumption” (1990, III., para 3) nor would it dare try to, as for Blondes to properly criticise the patriarchal systems it’s embedded in would mean to tear down the thematic and visual language of the film, rendering its purpose as a commercial product obsolete.

Gentlemen Prefer Blondes contradictory attempt to simultaneously satirise and adhere to patriarchal beliefs left the film without a clear ideological message for audiences to understand. By framing Hawks’ potential political intentions through Comolli and Narboni’s theoretical categories; exploring how Blondes visually adheres to the scopophilic objectification of women, resists against the patriarchy through its subversive depictions of conventional gender roles yet fails in its satire due to its celebration of capitalistic values. Blondes’ ultimately functions as a commodified ideological product for the patriarchal system, propagating the status quo through its erotic spectacle, narrative, and visual construction.
